# Position-Specific-Nutrition-Requirement-Predictor-for-Youth-Soccer-Players
Frontend (UI) still in progress (Beta Version)

A machine learning-based tool that predicts the nutritional requirements of young soccer players based on their on-field positions and physical specifications. The tool provides detailed calorie and gram macronutrient requirements from each food source to help athletes meet their dietary needs for optimal performance. The model has an accuracy (R2 score) of 0.924 (92.4%)

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Position Specific Calorie and Gram Predictor:** Accepts position and pairs it up with your height, weight and age to tailor nutritional requirements.
- **Interactive Frontend:** Simplified user friendly interface where you just select and predict!
- **Published Research Backing:** Published Research Paper *Predictive Analysis of position specific nutritional requirements in youth players using machine learning and data science techniques*, International Journal of Novel Research and Development (www.ijnrd.org), ISSN:2456-4184, Vol.8, Issue 9, page no.a547-a566, September-2023, Available: http://www.ijnrd.org/papers/IJNRD2309067.pdf with an impact factor of 8.76


## üéØ Target Audience

- Soccer Clubs
- Coaches and trainers of youth soccer players
- Nutritionists specializing in sports science/working in soccer corporations
- Researchers interested in sports nutrition and machine learning applications
- Parents and athletes looking for data-driven dietary guidance
- Individual athletes


## üí° Motivation

To commit to a personal project was a prerequisite for any aspiring pupil in the Machine Learning and Data Science field. However, I strived to do this in a unique way by mingling all my interests together into a single endeavor. Soccer, Machine Learning¬†and maintaining appropriate nutritional levels appealed to me greatly, so I devised a method to combine all three for creating technology that would address nutritional drawbacks and boost the well-being of my soccer playing peers. My program works on a dataset I compiled by conducting research on nutritional requirements of youth soccer players (position specific) in collaboration with Excellent Bio Research Solutions. I applied various machine learning techniques i had learnt during my internship to predict the number of calories required from each food source and utilize this information to optimize their diets. My research paper was published in the International Journal of Novel Research and Development.
